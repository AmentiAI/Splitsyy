# Development Email Verification Bypass Guide

This guide helps you bypass email verification during development so you can access the site immediately.

## ✅ Automatic Solutions (Recommended)

### Solution 1: Auto-Confirm on Registration (Now Active!)

**New users** will be automatically confirmed in development mode.

When you register a new account:
1. User is created in Supabase Auth
2. **In development mode**, email is auto-confirmed via admin API
3. You can login immediately - no email verification needed!

**How it works**:
- File: `app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- Automatically detects `NODE_ENV === "development"`
- Uses admin client to confirm email after registration
- You'll see: `✅ Email auto-confirmed in development mode` in console

**To test**:
```bash
# Register a new user (they'll be auto-confirmed)
# Then login immediately - it will work!
```

---

### Solution 2: Manual Confirmation Script (For Existing Users)

If you already registered users before this fix, use this script:

```bash
# Confirm a specific user's email
npx tsx scripts/confirm-user-email.ts your-email@example.com

# Example
npx tsx scripts/confirm-user-email.ts amentiaiserv@gmail.com
```

**What it does**:
- Looks up the user by email
- Confirms their email using admin API
- Shows success message
- Now you can login!

**Script location**: `scripts/confirm-user-email.ts`

## 🔧 Manual Solutions

### Solution 3: Supabase Dashboard (Hosted Instance)

If using Supabase Cloud:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to: **Authentication** → **Settings**
3. Scroll to **Email Auth** section
4. **Disable** "Enable email confirmations"
5. Click **Save**

Now all users can login without email verification!

---

### Solution 4: Manual Database Update

Manually confirm a user in Supabase Studio:

1. Open Supabase Studio: `http://localhost:54323`
2. Go to **Authentication** → **Users**
3. Find your user
4. Click on the user row
5. Look for `email_confirmed_at` field
6. If it's `null`, click **Edit**
7. Set `email_confirmed_at` to current timestamp
8. Save changes

---

### Solution 5: Local Config (Already Set!)

Your local Supabase config already has email confirmations disabled:

**File**: `supabase/config.toml`
```toml
[auth.email]
enable_signup = true
double_confirm_changes = true
enable_confirmations = false  # ← Already disabled!
```

If this isn't working, restart your Supabase instance:
```bash
npx supabase stop
npx supabase start
```

## 🚀 Quick Start for New Development

### Option A: Fresh Start
1. Delete existing users (if any)
2. Register a new account
3. ✅ Auto-confirmed in development mode
4. Login immediately

### Option B: Confirm Existing User
1. Run: `npx tsx scripts/confirm-user-email.ts your-email@example.com`
2. Login immediately

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Auto-Confirmation
```bash
# 1. Start your dev server
npm run dev

# 2. Register a new user at: http://localhost:3000/auth/register

# 3. Check the console - you should see:
⚠️  Development mode: Auto-confirming user email
✅ Email auto-confirmed in development mode

# 4. Go to login page and login immediately (no email verification needed!)
```

## 📋 Current Setup Summary

| Feature | Status | Location |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Auto-confirm on registration | ✅ Active | `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` |
| Manual confirmation script | ✅ Available | `scripts/confirm-user-email.ts` |
| Development bypass in login | ✅ Active | `app/api/auth/login/route.ts` |

## 🔒 Production Safety

All bypasses are **development-only**:

```typescript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development") {
  // Auto-confirm email
}
```

In production:
- Email verification is required
- No auto-confirmation happens
- Security is maintained

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Email not confirmed" error when logging in

**For existing users:**
```bash
npx tsx scripts/confirm-user-email.ts your-email@example.com
```

**For new registrations:**
- Make sure you're in development mode (`npm run dev`)
- Check console for auto-confirmation message
- If not working, use the manual confirmation script

### Script not found error
```bash
# Install tsx if needed
npm install -D tsx

# Then run the script
npx tsx scripts/confirm-user-email.ts your-email@example.com
```

### Can't find user
```bash
# List all users
npx tsx scripts/confirm-user-email.ts invalid@email.com

# It will show all available users
```
